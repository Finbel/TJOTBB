A top-down turn-based zombie-survival cave-crawling role-playing-game  with touches of classical pixelart-platforming.


LEGEND:

You are the GREEN SQUARE

Your goal is to get to the BLUE SQUARE

The BLINKING SQUARES are zombies, they roam arounds randomly 
unless you get too close, then they attack you (you can't run away).

The LIGHT GRAY SQUARES are tiles that you can walk on

The BLACK SQUARES are walls, these can not be passed in any way.

The DARK GRAY SQUARES are doors, these can be opened 
in which case they turn into WHITE SQUARES signalling that they are open.

sometimes you will need a key to open a door, the YELLO SQUARES are keys.
